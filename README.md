# Remote Evaluation Workflows for GitHub Actions

This repository stores GitHub Actions workflows designed to be triggered remotely by other repositories, such as [pn-cap/use-case-backend-test](https://github.com/pn-cap/use-case-backend-test).

## Available Workflows

- **evaluation_parametrized-remote.yml**  
  A parametrized workflow for running Python-based evaluation scripts.  
  It supports manual (`workflow_dispatch`) and remote (`workflow_call`) triggers, allowing you to specify:
  - Python version
  - Working directory
  - Requirements file path
  - Evaluation script path

## Usage

To trigger these workflows from another repository, use the `workflow_call` event in your workflow YAML.  

Example usage from a test repo:

```yaml
jobs:
  call-remote-evaluation:
    uses: pn-cap/remote-workflows-test/.github/workflows/evaluation_parametrized-remote.yml@main
    with:
      python_version: '3.11'
      working_directory: './'
      requirements_filepath: './requirements.txt'
      evaluation_filepath: './evaluation/evaluation.py'
```

## Output  
* Results from the evaluation are posted as comments on pull requests if triggered by a PR event.  
* The workflow expects a results.md file to be generated by your evaluation script.

## Reference  
* Test repository: [pn-cap/use-case-backend-test](https://github.com/pn-cap/use-case-backend-test).
